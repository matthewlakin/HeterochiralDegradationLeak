# Computational modeling of heterochiral degradation-induced leak

## Description

- This code accompanies the manuscript "On degradation-induced leak in heterochiral DNA strand displacement cascades".
- It includes model definitions and data for running simulations and fitting the model to the experimental data provided.

## Getting Started

- The package contains this README file, a LICENSE file and the src folder.
- The src folder contains the code and data for running the model fitting and generating plots.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* ProBioSim simulator (available from https://github.com/matthewlakin/ProBioSim)

## Executing programs

- The jupyter notebook in the src directory contains code to run the models.
